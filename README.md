# FINTECH-Project-01

## Team 07
* Corey Recai
* Louis Zibi
* Toufic Lawand

## Project summary
This project aims to compare the US financial market performance (SPY at the macro level) over the period between Nov 2019 and Apr 2020 vs. Covid-19 cases (_11/19 through 4/20 vs 11/18 through 4/19_).

Throughout our analysis, we will be covering the following sectors:
* technology (toufic)
* commercial real estate (corey)
* retail (louis)

## Tools and datasets used
_TBD_

## Questions
1. How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the US economy and markets?
2. Out of the three sectors we've chosen (technology, commercial real estate, and retail), which sector has been hit the most? And which one has benefited the most (if any)?
3. Which (publicly listed) companies have gained the most from the COVID-19 pandemic? And which have lost the most?
4. If we were to pick one of the top 5 performers and one of the bottom 5 performers from each sector we're examining, what is the range of their expected price in 5 years for a 90% confidence interval? (based on historical data for the past _20 years_ if available)
